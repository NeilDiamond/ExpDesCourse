# ExpDesCourse
Notes to Session 5 of the course given to a manufacturer based in Brisbane. 
Will form the basis for a short course in Factorial and Fractional Factorial Designs and Response Surface Methodology.

Currently the course is in Minitab and R but the plan is to change the notes into two versions-one 
based on R and one based on Minitab.
